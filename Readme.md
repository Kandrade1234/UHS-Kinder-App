We are doing a learn to read Kindergarten app to aid with rehabilitation for students who are having trouble reading. This app will have a list of words and each list contains 10 words. If you click on the word then a flashcard appears and the goal is to sound the word out. This app is still in progress and is being made for Dr Steinberg. on the upcoming days we will be making the app look nicer and add a voice feedback functionality for words that are "tough" to read. we will also have a shuffle functionality and much more
